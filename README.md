# NetSim

# INTRODUCTION
This C++ project implements a network simulation, utilizing various data structures to model routers, machines, and message routing. The program reads network configuration from a CSV file, creating a routing matrix based on the connectivity and priorities specified. It employs priority queues for message management, linked lists for routing tables, and queues for message handling within routers and machines. The project aims to simulate message routing within a network, demonstrating the application of data structure concepts like priority queues, linked lists, and queues in the context of network communication.
